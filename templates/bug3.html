from flask import Flask, render_template

            <p>

	User expects flask to print an exception traceback in the console while showing the internal server error in browser. Works when debug is set to false but not when debug is set to true.</p>
              <p>    - Is an issue in Python 3.5.2 but not in Python 2.7</p>


            <p>This is due to a socket error meaning that the computer cannot connect to another computer or server.
</p>

            <h2>Concept Location</h2>
            <img src="{{ url_for('static', filename="img/img/1995_concept_location.png") }}" style="display:block; margin: 0 auto;width:80%;"/>


            <div>
            </div>

                <h2>Fix</h2>

                  <p>My solution: determine if error is of exact type socket.error. Operating system vs. server. Checking which version of python is being run. See images below.
                  </p>

                  <p>Both of my attempts did not work. In this case it was that the Werkzeug library overloaded the server causing it to fail.  This means that the issue was not in Flask but in an external library that Flask calls.
                  </p>

                    <p>   - Issue in the Werkzeug library:  while waiting for the Werkzeug server to respond, NGINX closes itself off from the library. So when a python program tries to respond and exception occurs.  Documented as an issue in pallets/Werkzeug. #954.
                    </p>
		
		<p>Since this bug is within a template I figured that it would change the way the template interacted with the debugger</p>
		<p>However the despite the attempted changes to the bug it did not impact anything.</p>
